THINGS TO DO
 * Add additional SQL engines (sqlite, postgresql, mssql) to ASql.
 * Use template specialization to improve Request::emptyBuffer().
 * Add the ability to fillPosts() to handle non utf-8 character sets when
   wchar_t is used as the Request template parameter. Possibly through iconv.
 * Make requests time out
 * Allow for multiple POST values of the same name
